Note: Should you have any problems installing OHD please contact us at info@omnihelpdesk.com.

1. Main OHD installation

1.1. Unzip the ohd[version].zip onto your local hard drive.

1.2. Rename the directory to whatever you want. (e.g. support)

1.3. Login to your website control panel and create a database (e.g. ohd) You also need to 
     create a username and password for this database. Give full access rights to the username
     of the database you just created. 
     Note: DB user should have right to create and drop temporary tables.
     
1.4. If you have unzipped ohd to your local hard drive simply upload it to the web server.
     This is done usually via FTP. I recommend CuteFTP http://www.cuteftp.com
     
1.5. Chmod ohd/install folder to 777.     
     Chmod ohd/_tmp/attachments folder to 777.
     Chmod ohd/_tmp/sess folder to 777.
     Chmod ohd/_tmp/template_c folder to 777.
     Chmod ohd/_tmp/uploads folder to 777.
